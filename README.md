# Spotify-Playlist-Sorter

Developed a Java program that uses an algorithm to determine whether a song should be added to one of three tailored playlists in Spotify based on user preferences and genre-specific criteria. The program processes a list of songs, checking each song's composition (pop, rock, country) and matching it to the appropriate playlist or rejecting it if the requirements are unmet. This project demonstrates a system where multiple classes integrate together to automate playlist management based on user-defined criteria.

Key features:

• Ensures songs meet playlist-specific genre composition and capacity constraints
• Provides users with the option to accept or reject songs based on recommendations
• Simulates and visualizes the decision-making process for playlist assignments
• Implements several data structures, encapsulation, interfaces, and file I/O to manage the flow of data and interactions between component
