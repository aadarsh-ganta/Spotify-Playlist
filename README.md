Version 1.0 Created by Prakash Chatlani About:

Blackjack is a card game to reach 21. If a player goes over, then he "busts" and loses
In my version of Blackjack, it will be a one-player game against the computer (dealer).
The player starts with $10 and can wager however much they want
A player earns more if they get blackjack on the first dealing
There is no limit to how much you can win! Have fun!
Future features:

add split feature (if a user starts with two of the same cards, then allow to split and play those individually)
2-player mode by adding Player classes
